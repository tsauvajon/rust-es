Current features:

- produce messages
- consume messages (single consumer group/pull only)

Features I might add:

- persist to disk (append-only log)
- multiple consumer groups
- offsets
- produce and consume on the same port
- produce/consume multiple messages at once (bulk)
- push when new messages arrive and the consumer is waiting
